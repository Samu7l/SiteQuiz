        { "text": "The hash function is one way and irreversible.", "isCorrect": true },

      "explanation": "A cryptographic hash function should have the following properties:<br>1. The input can be any length.<br>2. The <b>output has a fixed length</b>.<br>3. The hash value is relatively easy to compute for any given input.<br>4. The hash is <b>one way and not reversible</b>.<br>5. The hash is collision free, meaning that two different input values will result in different hash values."
