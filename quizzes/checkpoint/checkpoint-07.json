This may involve decompression or decryption of the data.<br><b>Analysis</b> - drawing conclusions from the data. Salient features, such as people, places, times, events, and so on should be documented.<br><b>Reporting</b>  - preparing and presenting information that resulted from the analysis. Reporting should be impartial and alternative explanations should be offered if appropriate."
