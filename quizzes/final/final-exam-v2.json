      "explanation": "Syslog servers aggregate logs from various network devices. These logs are critical for forensic analysis as they may contain evidence of an intrusion. Threat actors target these servers to <b>delete or alter log files</b>, thereby removing information that could lead to the detection of their exploits and covering their tracks."

      "explanation": "<b>Software-defined networks (SDN)</b> enable new types of security controls and provide an overall gain for network security including: Easy network isolation without constraints of physical hardware. SDN firewalls (security groups in cloud computing) applied to assets based on more flexible criteria than hardware firewalls."
