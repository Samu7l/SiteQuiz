      "id": "fe4-q1",
      "question": "Refer to the exhibit. A router has an existing ACL that permits all traffic from the 172.16.0.0 network. The administrator attempts to add a new ACE to the ACL that denies packets from host 172.16.0.1 and receives the error message that is shown in the exhibit. What action can the administrator take to block packets from host 172.16.0.1 while still permitting all other traffic from the 172.16.0.0 network?",

        { "text": "Add a deny any any ACE to access-list 1.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Because the new deny statement is a host address that falls within the existing 172.16.0.0 network that is permitted, the router rejects the command and displays an error message. For the new deny statement to take effect, it must be manually configured by the administrator with a sequence number that is less than 10."

Although they do not indicate that an undetected exploit has occurred, they are costly because cybersecurity analysts must investigate false alarms; therefore, time is taken away from investigation of alerts that indicate true exploits.<br><b>True negatives</b> are desirable. They indicate that benign normal traffic is correctly ignored, and erroneous alerts are not being issued.<br>False negatives are dangerous. They indicate that exploits are not being detected by the security systems that are in place. These incidents could go undetected for a long time, and ongoing data loss and damage could result."
