    {
      "id": "m1-q1",
      "question": "What type of attack occurs when data goes beyond the memory areas allocated to an application?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "SQL injection", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "RAM injection", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "RAM spoofing", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Buffer overflow", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "A buffer overflow occurs when data is written beyond the limits of a buffer. By modifying data outside the allocated boundaries, the application may access memory intended for other processes. This can lead to system crashes, data compromise, or even privilege escalation."
    },
    {
      "id": "m1-q2",
      "question": "Which of the following statements describes a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "An attacker sends an enormous quantity of data that a server cannot handle", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "An attacker monitors network traffic to learn authentication credentials", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "One computer accepts data packets based on the MAC address of another computer", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "A botnet of zombies, coordinated by an attacker, overwhelms a server with DoS attacks", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "In a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the attacker uses multiple compromised computer systems, known as zombies, to flood a targeted server with traffic. The server becomes overwhelmed and is unable to respond to legitimate requests."
    },
    {
      "id": "m1-q3",
      "question": "Employees in an organization report that the network access is slow. Further investigation reveals that one employee downloaded a third-party scanning program for the printer. What type of malware may have been introduced?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Worm", "isCorrect": true },

    {
      "id": "m1-q4",
      "question": "Employees in an organization report that they cannot access the customer database on the main server. Further investigation reveals that the database file is now encrypted. Shortly afterward, the organization receives a threatening email demanding payment for the decryption of the database file. What type of attack has the organization experienced?",

        { "text": "Trojan horse", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "In a ransomware attack, the attacker compromises the victim’s computer and encrypts the data so it is no longer accessible. The attacker then demands payment from the victim in exchange for decrypting the data."
    },
    {
      "id": "m1-q5",
      "question": "A penetration test carried out by an organization identified a backdoor on the network. What action should the organization take to find out if their systems have been compromised?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Scan the systems for viruses", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "Social engineering", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Pharming", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Social engineering is a technique where cybercriminals manipulate or deceive individuals to obtain personal or sensitive information. They often rely on trust, familiarity, or psychological manipulation rather than technical hacking methods."
    },
    {
      "id": "m1-q7",
      "question": "A secretary receives a phone call from someone claiming that their manager is about to give an important presentation but the presentation files are corrupted. The caller sternly asks that the secretary email the presentation right away to a personal email address. The caller also states that the secretary is being held personally responsible for the success of this presentation. What type of social engineering tactic is the caller using?",

        { "text": "Man-in-the-middle", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "In a spoofing attack, attackers disguise their device or identity by using a valid address from the network, allowing them to bypass authentication. MAC and IP addresses can be spoofed, and this technique is often used to exploit ARP trust relationships."
    },
    {
      "id": "m1-q11",
      "question": "A cybercriminal sends a series of maliciously formatted packets to a database server, which causes the server to crash. What do you call this type of attack?",
