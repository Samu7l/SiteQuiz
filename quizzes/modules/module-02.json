      "question": "The IT department performs a thorough assessment of security posture for the company data center operation. The risk of potential loss or compromise of critical data is identified. In discussion with the management team, a decision is reached that the critical data should be replicated to a cloud service provider and further insured with an insurance company.

      ],
      "explanation": "There are four common ways to manage risk: \n - Risk transfer - Some or all the risk is transferred to a willing third party such as a cloud service provider or an insurance company.\n - Risk reduction - This reduces exposure to risk or reduces the impact of risk by taking action to decrease the risk. This strategy requires careful evaluation of the costs of loss, the mitigation strategy, and the benefits gained from the operation or activity that is at risk. \n - Risk avoidance - This means avoiding any exposure to the risk by eliminating the activity or device that presents the risk. By eliminating an activity to avoid risk, any benefits that are possible from the activity are also lost.\n - Risk acceptance - This is when the cost of risk management options outweighs the cost of the risk itself. The risk is accepted, and no action is taken."

Hacktivists publicly protest against organizations or governments by posting articles, videos, leaking sensitive information, and performing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. \n - Cybercriminals - a term for black hat hackers who are either self-employed or working for large cybercrime organizations. Each year, cyber criminals are responsible for stealing billions of dollars from consumers and businesses.\n - State-Sponsored hackers - threat actors who steal government secrets, gather intelligence, and sabotage networks of foreign governments, terrorist groups, and corporations. Most countries in the world participate to some degree in state-sponsored hacking.\n - Vulnerability brokers - typically grey hat hackers who attempt to discover exploits and report them to vendors, sometimes for prizes or rewards."
