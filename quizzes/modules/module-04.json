    {
      "id": "m4-q1",
      "question": "Which action best describes a MAC address spoofing attack?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "altering the MAC address of an attacking host to match that of a legitimate host", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "bombarding a switch with fake source MAC addresses", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "forcing the election of a rogue root bridge", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "flooding the LAN with excessive traffic", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The attacker commonly runs a program or script that sends a stream of frames to the switch so the switch keeps the incorrect (spoofed) information in the MAC address table."
    },
    {
      "id": "m4-q2",
      "question": "What is an objective of a DHCP spoofing attack?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "to gain illegal access to a DHCP server and modify its configuration", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "to attack a DHCP server and make it unable to provide valid IP addresses to DHCP clients", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "to intercept DHCP messages and alter the information before sending to DHCP clients", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "to provide false DNS server addresses to DHCP clients so that visits to a legitimate web server are directed to a fake server", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "In DHCP spoofing attacks, an attacker configures a fake DHCP server on the network to provide false DNS server addresses to clients. When a client tries to access a server using a server domain name (for example, a web server), the name to IP resolution request is sent to a DNS server that is under the control of the attacker, which provides the IP address of a fake server."
    },
    {
      "id": "m4-q3",
      "question": "What is the primary means for mitigating virus and Trojan horse attacks?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "antivirus software", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "encryption", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "antisniffer software", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "blocking ICMP echo and echo-replies", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Antivirus software is the primary means of mitigating both virus and Trojan horse attacks. By using up-to-date antivirus software, the spread of viruses and Trojan horse attacks can be reduced."
    },
    {
      "id": "m4-q4",
      "question": "What method can be used to mitigate ping sweeps?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "blocking ICMP echo and echo-replies at the network edge", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "deploying antisniffer software on all network devices", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "using encrypted or hashed authentication protocols", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "installing antivirus software on hosts", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "To mitigate ping sweeps, ICMP echo and echo-reply messages can be blocked on network edge routers. This does come at a cost. Because ICMP is also used for network diagnostic data, this diagnostic data will be blocked as well."

    {
      "id": "m4-q5",
      "question": "What worm mitigation phase involves actively disinfecting infected systems?",
      "type": "single",

        { "text": "quarantine", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "inoculation", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "treatment", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "containment", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The four phases of worm mitigation are: Containment, Inoculation, Quarantine, Treatment. Disinfecting systems is accomplished in the treatment phase and involves terminating the worm process, removing infected files, and patching vulnerabilities exploited by the worm."

      "id": "m4-q6",
      "question": "What is the result of a DHCP starvation attack?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Legitimate clients are unable to lease IP addresses.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Clients receive IP address assignments from a rogue DHCP server.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "The attacker provides incorrect DNS and default gateway information to clients.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "The IP addresses assigned to legitimate clients are hijacked.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "DCHP starvation attacks are launched by an attacker with the intent to create a DoS for DHCP clients. To accomplish this goal, the attacker uses a tool that sends many DHCPDISCOVER messages to lease the entire pool of available IP addresses, thus denying them to legitimate hosts."

    {
      "id": "m4-q7",
      "question": "Which term is used for bulk advertising emails flooded to as many end users as possible?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Phishing", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Brute force", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Spam", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Adware", "isCorrect": false }

      "id": "m4-q8",
      "question": "Which type of DNS attack involves the cybercriminal compromising a parent domain and creating multiple subdomains to be used during the attacks?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "cache poisoning", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "amplification and reflection", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "tunneling", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "shadowing", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "Two threats to DNS are DNS shadowing and DNS tunneling attacks. DNS shadowing attacks compromise a parent domain and then the cybercriminal creates subdomains to be used in attacks. DNS tunneling attacks build botnets to bypass traditional security solutions."

        { "text": "ARP", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "DHCP", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The HTTP 302 cushioning attack is used by cybercriminals to take advantage of the 302 Found HTTP response status code to redirect the browser of the user to a new location, usually a malicious site."

      "explanation": "Cybercriminals use SQL injections to breach a relational database, create malicious SQL queries, and obtain sensitive data."
    },
    {
      "id": "m4-q11",
      "question": "Which two attacks target web servers through exploiting possible vulnerabilities of input functions used by an application? (Choose two.)",

      "question": "What is a characteristic of a DNS amplification and reflection attack?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Threat actors use DNS open resolvers to increase the volume of attacks and to hide the true source of an attack.", "isCorrect": true },
