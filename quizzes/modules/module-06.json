      "question": "What is the purpose of a personal firewall on a computer?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "to protect the computer from viruses and malware", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "to protect the hardware against fire hazard", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "to increase the speed of the Internet connection", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "to filter the traffic that is moving in and out of the PC", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "The purpose of a firewall is to filter the traffic that is moving in and out of the PC. A computer firewall cannot deny all illegal traffic from a computer or increase the speed of any connection."

      "id": "m6-q2",
      "question": "What is the main difference between the implementation of IDS and IPS devices?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "An IDS uses signature-based technology to detect malicious packets, whereas an IPS uses profile-based technology.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "An IDS can negatively impact the packet flow, whereas an IPS can not.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "An IDS would allow malicious traffic to pass before it is addressed, whereas an IPS stops it immediately.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "An IDS needs to be deployed together with a firewall device, whereas an IPS can replace a firewall.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "An IPS is deployed in inline mode and will not allow malicious traffic to enter the internal network without first analyzing it. An advantage of this is that it can stop an attack immediately. An IDS is deployed in promiscuous mode. It copies the traffic patterns and analyzes them offline, thus it cannot stop the attack immediately and it relies on another device to take further actions once it detects an attack. Being deployed in inline mode, an IPS can negatively impact the traffic flow. Both IDS and IPS can use signature-based technology to detect malicious packets. An IPS cannot replace other security devices, such as firewalls, because they perform different tasks."

      "id": "m6-q4",
      "question": "What is a feature of the TACACS+ protocol?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "It hides passwords during transmission using PAP and sends the rest of the packet in plaintext.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "It encrypts the entire body of the packet for more secure communications.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "It combines authentication and authorization as one process.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "It utilizes UDP to provide more efficient packet transfer.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "TACACS+ separates authentication and authorization, encrypts all communication, and uses TCP port 49."

      "id": "m6-q5",
      "question": "Which firewall feature is used to ensure that packets coming into a network are legitimate responses to requests initiated from internal hosts?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "stateful packet inspection", "isCorrect": true },

        { "text": "application filtering", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "URL filtering", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Stateful packet inspection on a firewall checks that incoming packets are actually legitimate responses to requests originating from hosts inside the network. Packet filtering can be used to permit or deny access to resources based on IP or MAC address. Application filtering can permit or deny access based on port number. URL filtering is used to permit or deny access based on URL or on keywords."

      "id": "m6-q6",
      "question": "Refer to the exhibit. The network 'A' contains multiple corporate servers that are accessed by hosts from the Internet for information about the corporation. What term is used to describe the network marked as 'A'?",

      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "perimeter security boundary", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "untrusted network", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "DMZ", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "A demilitarized zone or DMZ is a network area protected by one or more firewalls. The DMZ typically contains servers that are commonly accessed by external users."

        { "text": "It is a cloud-based security service to scan traffic for malware and policy enforcement.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "It is a security appliance that provides an all-in-one solution for securing and controlling web traffic.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The Cisco Cloud Web Security (CWS) is a cloud-based security service that uses web proxies in the Cisco cloud environment to scan traffic for malware and policy enforcement. It is not a firewall or web server solution. The Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) combines multiple security solutions to provide an all-in-one solution on a single platform to address the challenges of securing and controlling web traffic."

        { "text": "NTP servers ensure an accurate time stamp on logging and debugging information.", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize the time across all devices on the network to make sure accurate timestamping on devices for managing, securing and troubleshooting. The stratum 1 devices are directly connected to the authoritative time sources."

      "question": "How is a source IP address used in a standard ACL?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "It is the address that is unknown, so the ACL must be placed on the interface closest to the source address.", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "It is the criterion that is used to filter traffic.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "It is the address to be used by a router to determine the best path to forward packets.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The only filter that can be applied with a standard ACL is the source IP address. An extended ACL is used to filter on such traffic as the source IP address, destination IP address, type of traffic, and type of message."
