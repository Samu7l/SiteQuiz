      "question": "In a defense-in-depth approach, which three options must be identified to effectively defend a network against attacks? (Choose three.)",
      "type": "multiple",
      "options": [

      "question": "Which device is usually the first line of defense in a layered defense-in-depth approach?",

      "id": "m11-q3",
      "question": "Which device in a layered defense-in-depth approach denies connections initiated from untrusted networks to internal networks, but allows internal users within an organization to connect to untrusted networks?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "IPS", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "firewall", "isCorrect": true },

        { "text": "cabbage", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The artichoke is now used to provide a visual analogy to describe a defense-in-depth security approach because a single petal or leaf can be moved or removed to reveal sensitive information, unlike the older onion analogy."

      "question": "What is the benefit of a defense-in-depth approach?",

      "options": [
        { "text": "The effectiveness of other security measures is not impacted when a security mechanism fails.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Only a single layer of security at the network core is required.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "All network vulnerabilities are mitigated.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "The need for firewalls is eliminated.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The benefit of the defense-in-depth approach is that network defenses are implemented in layers so that failure of any single security mechanism does not impact other security measures."

      "explanation": "An AUP would list prohibited websites. Any changes to this must be updated immediately and signed by all users to be enforced effectively."
