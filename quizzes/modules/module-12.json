    {
      "id": "m12-q1",
      "question": "A user has created a new program and wants to distribute it to everyone in the company. The user wants to ensure that when the program is downloaded that the program is not changed while in transit. What can the user do to ensure that the program is not changed when downloaded?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Create a hash of the program file that can be used to verify the integrity of the file after it is downloaded.", "isCorrect": true },

      "question": "A user is running a routine audit of the server hardware in the company data center. Several servers are using single drives to host operating systems and multiple types of attached storage solutions for storing data. The user wants to offer a better solution to provide fault tolerance during a drive failure. Which solution is best?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [

      "explanation": "Fault tolerance is addressing a single point of failure, in this case the hard drives. RAID provides this redundancy."
    },
    {
      "id": "m12-q3",
      "question": "A user was hired by a company to provide a highly available network infrastructure. The user wants to build redundancy into the network in case of a switch failure, but wants to prevent Layer 2 looping. What would the user implement in the network?",

      "id": "m12-q7",
      "question": "A company wants to implement biometric access to its data center. The company is concerned with people being able to circumvent the system by being falsely accepted as legitimate users. What type of error is false acceptance?",
