      "question": "In applying an ACL to a router interface, which traffic is designated as outbound?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "traffic that is leaving the router and going toward the destination host", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "traffic that is going from the destination IP address into the router", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "traffic for which the router can find no routing table entry", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "traffic that is coming from the source IP address into the router", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Inbound and outbound are interpreted from the point of view of the router. Traffic that is designated in an outbound ACL will be denied or permitted when going out the interface to the destination."

      "id": "m14-q2",
      "question": "Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator wants to create a standard ACL to prevent network 1 traffic from being transmitted to the Research and Development network. On which router interface and in which direction should the standard ACL be applied?",

        { "text": "R1 Gi0/0 inbound", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Standard ACLs can only specify source addresses, so the standard ACL should be placed as close to the destination as possible. The destination is the Research and Development LAN (R2 Gi0/0 interface)."

        { "text": "If an ACL contains no permit statements, all traffic is denied by default.", "isCorrect": true },

        { "text": "If a single ACL is to be applied to multiple interfaces, it must be configured with a unique number for each interface.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Multiple ACLs per protocol and per direction can be applied to an interface.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Standard ACLs are placed closest to the source, whereas extended ACLs are placed closest to the destination.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "An implicit deny any exists at the end of all ACLs. Specific statements must be placed at the top because processing stops after the first match."

      "question": "Refer to the exhibit. A network administrator is configuring an IPv6 ACL to allow hosts on the 2001:DB8:CAFÉ:10::/64 network to access remote web servers, except for PC1. However, a user on PC1 can successfully access the web server PC2. Why is this possible?",
