      "question": "Which statement describes a feature of a zone-based policy firewall?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "The router security posture is to allow traffic unless explicitly blocked.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "It does not depend on ACLs.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "It uses a flat, non-hierarchical data structure making it easier to configure and troubleshoot.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "All traffic through a given interface is subject to the same inspection.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "A zone-based policy firewall (ZPF) does not require the use of complex ACLs. By default, traffic traveling between zones is blocked unless specifically permitted."
    },
    {
      "id": "m16-q2",
      "question": "Which statement describes a zone when implementing ZPF on a Cisco router?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "A zone is used to implement traffic filtering for either TCP or UDP.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "A zone establishes a security border of a network.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "A zone is used to define security policies for a unique interface on the router.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Only one zone can be attached to a single interface.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Zones establish the security borders of a network. A zone defines a boundary where traffic is subjected to policy restrictions as it crosses to another region of the network."
    },
    {
      "id": "m16-q3",
      "question": "Designing a ZPF requires several steps. Which step involves defining boundaries where traffic is subjected to policy restrictions as it crosses to another region of the network?",

        { "text": "identify subsets within zones and merge traffic requirements", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The first step in designing a ZPF is determining the zones, which involves separating the network into zones that establish security borders."
    },

      "id": "m16-q4",
      "question": "Which statement describes one of the rules that govern interface behavior in the context of implementing a zone-based policy firewall configuration?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "An administrator can assign an interface to multiple security zones.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "By default, traffic is allowed to flow among interfaces that are members of the same zone.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "By default, traffic is allowed to flow between a zone member interface and any interface that is not a zone member.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "An administrator can assign interfaces to zones, regardless of whether the zone has been configured.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Interfaces that belong to the same zone allow traffic flow between them by default. An interface can belong to only one zone."
    },
    {
      "id": "m16-q5",
      "question": "Which three statements describe zone-based policy firewall rules that govern interface behavior and the traffic moving between zone member interfaces? (Choose three.)",
      "type": "multiple",
      "options": [
        { "text": "Traffic is implicitly prevented from flowing by default among interfaces that are members of the same zone.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "Pass, inspect, and drop options can only be applied between two zones.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "Interfaces can be assigned to a zone before the zone is created.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "If traffic is to flow between all interfaces in a router, each interface must be a member of a zone.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "An interface can be assigned to multiple security zones.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "To permit traffic to and from a zone member interface, a policy allowing or inspecting traffic must be configured between that zone and any other zone.", "isCorrect": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "If traffic is to flow between all interfaces, each must be in a zone. Policies (pass, inspect, drop) are applied between zones. Traffic flow requires a policy between different zones."
    },
    {
      "id": "m16-q6",
      "question": "In ZPF design, what is described as the self zone?",
      "type": "single",

        { "text": "the outward facing interface on the edge router", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "The self zone is the router itself and includes all the IP addresses assigned to the router interfaces."

    {
      "id": "m16-q7",
      "question": "How does ZPF handle traffic between an interface that is a zone member and another interface that does not belong to any zone?",

        { "text": "allow", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "If one interface is a zone member and the other is not, the resulting action is to drop the traffic regardless of whether a zone-pair exists."

      "question": "Which statement describes a factor to be considered when configuring a zone-based policy firewall?",

      "options": [
        { "text": "An interface can belong to multiple zones.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "A zone must be configured with the zone security global command before it can be used in the zone-member security command.", "isCorrect": true },
        { "text": "The router always filters the traffic between interfaces in the same zone.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "The classic firewall ip inspect command can coexist with ZPF as long as it is used on interfaces that are in the same security zones.", "isCorrect": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "A zone must be created (using the zone security global command) before it can be assigned to an interface."
