      "question": "What is the purpose of the DH algorithm?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "to generate a shared secret between two hosts that have not communicated before", "isCorrect": true },

      "question": "Which statement is a feature of HMAC?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "HMAC is based on the RSA hash function.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "HMAC uses a secret key that is only known to the sender and defeats man-in-the-middle attacks.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "HMAC uses protocols such as SSL or TLS to provide session layer confidentiality.", "isCorrect": false },
        { "text": "HMAC uses a secret key as input to the hash function, adding authentication to integrity assurance.", "isCorrect": true }
      ],

      "question": "An investigator finds a USB drive at a crime scene and wants to present it as evidence in court. The investigator takes the USB drive and creates a forensic image of it and takes a hash of both the original USB device and the image that was created. What is the investigator attempting to prove about the USB drive when the evidence is submitted in court?",
      "type": "single",
      "options": [
        { "text": "An exact copy cannot be made of a device.", "isCorrect": false },

        { "text": "The data is all there.", "isCorrect": false }
